# Class 6: Inheritance

## Agenda
- Announcements
    - Multiple TA absences tomorrow, please have patience on grading and getting help.
    - Happy Hour on Thursday! If you plan to attend, [register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/happy-hour-at-code-fellows-tickets-61067113380?aff=slack) so we have enough supplies. You'll still have your usual Thursday interview code challenge.
    - First Career Coaching workshop will be on Friday
        - Be here at 9am!
        - Will focus on Amazon leadership principles
    - Code Challenge overview: what does this week look like?
    - Feedback review
- Code review
- Daily Systems: Environment variables
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
- Lab intro
    - It's intentionally open-ended; come up with the implementation that seems reasonable to you, and we'll discuss during code review tomorrow.
        - Fine to talk about strategies with each other!
    - Lots of it is about planning, not writing code. That's OK.

## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Whiteboard challenges/code challenges
    - Great! Those will continue.
- The discussion about time/space complexity (and in general, Friday's review and intro to LinkedLists)
    - I'm literally always happy to talk more about Big O; ask me about it anytime!
- Demo code as something to work off of
    - I always try to push that code after class; if I forget, please remind me.

### The Mixed

- READMEs were hard to figure out at first, but now it's helpful to see good structure for them
    - The resources from the example code challenge directory are new, and I'll definitely include that on day 1 for future cohorts.
- Code review is often listed as "most helpful" but also sometimes listed as "least helpful/a waste of time"
    - In general, it's most helpful to people for whom this content is newer, so we'll keep spending time on it.

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- People having side conversations during lecture, distracting classmates
    - I'll try harder to quiet folks down.
- Setup of code challenges repo
    - The new guide/example repo was mentioned as being helpful, and that'll be a part of day 1 from now on.
    - I'm trying to also add a set of specific directions into the README of that repo.
    - At this point, you have patterns for all the types of challenges you'll do.
- IntelliJ is a hard adjustment
    - With your Amazon versions of IntelliJ, it's harder for me to help debug if your installation of IntelliJ is broken.
    - And working with a full build system, there are many more opportunities for errors to arise in configuration.
    - Please keep coming to us EARLY if you encounter build issues during lab!
- TAs who don't know Java
    - I also wish we had a larger pool of TAs who know Java. [you all are part of the problem ;-P ]
    - In general, if a TA can't solve your problem in 5-10 minutes, it's time to escalate to another TA or to me.
- Repeated learning journals
    - You can have the choice: rather than doing a repeated prompt to reflect on learning, you may instead reflect on lab for the day using the [retrospective directions](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/readings_and_reflections/retrospective.html).
    - I put a link to those directions at the top of the syllabus in Canvas.
- Partner Power Hour
    - It's optional now!

## Warmup Questions

1. What is inheritance?
2. What does it mean for one class to inherit from another class?
3. What are interfaces? What are the differences between a class and an interface?
4. What was the relationship between our `LinkedList` class and our `Node` class?
