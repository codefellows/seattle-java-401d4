# Final Project Requirements


Your final project must use a variety of AWS services to build an interesting, well-thought-out, complete application.

Specifically, you must:

1. Combine AWS services together to make something interesting.
    - Use IAM for proper security & account management.
    - Use CodePipeline, CodeBuild, etc. for CI/CD.
    - Use at least 3 other AWS services (at a minimum).
        - At least 2 of those must be services we covered in class.
        - This minimum is intentionally low; I anticipate that many of your projects will use 5ish additional AWS services, but I don't want you scrambling to incorporate unnecessary services into an otherwise well-architected application.

2. Document your application.
    - Include a README.md file with:
        - An overview of the application and its functionality
        - Screenshots of the application
        - A link to the deployed application (where applicable)
        - Links to any other repos used in the application (where applicable)
        - A list of technologies used in the application
        - Directions to run the application, both for local development and in production
            - these should be very detailed!
        - Links to each team member's GitHub profile
    - Include relevant comments in your code.
        - Do NOT include irrelevant comments or dead code in your application.

3. Test your application.
    - Must contain unit tests for constructors/getters/setters.
    - Must contain unit tests for any logic or utility methods.
    - Must contain at LEAST one end to end test that tests the entire flow of your application.

4. Deploy your application to the world.
    - Your application must be available online.
    - Your application should use a custom domain name, where applicable.
