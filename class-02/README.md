## Array Warmup
1. What does the syntax look like to create an array with the numbers `1,2,3`?
2. How do we get the length of an array?
3. How do we get or update the value at a particular index of an array?
4. What are some ways we can loop through an array?

### Limitations of ArrayLists
- have to import
- the constructor is weird
- still have to declare the type of elements inside
- still only one data type
