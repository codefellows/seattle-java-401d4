## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- While most project teams had their fare share of challenges and struggles throughtout the week, project week proved to be a good, solidifying, experience for most people.
- Mob debugging with team members was helpful.
- TA, staff, and peer support was in abundance.  Lot's of help available when it was needed.
- Code challenges!


### The Mixed

- Project team group dynamics.  Some teams had a fantastic experience working with their team.  Other teams had interpersonal and professional roadblocks that caused tension and/or added stress.
- Several students think that project week should be longer given the density/depth of the projects!

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- The broadband being down on Monday (and partially on Tuesday).
- Testing, in particular integration testing, was a struggle to understand and implement.
- Learning journals felt like too much to manage in addition to meeting project week requirements.
