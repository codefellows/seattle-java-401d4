## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful
    - Breaking down AWS into small pieces
        - yessssssssssssssssssss
        - this was my #1 goal for the last two weeks
    - Lightning talks
    - Config labs
    - Group assignments
        - you are going to love this week

### The Least Helpful
    - Expectations on lightning talks were unclear up until late last week
        - Agreed, it was a new assignment w/ new requirements
        - Final format (nothing personal, just AWS service) seemed to be well-liked, so planning to use that going forward
        - Working on official final project requirements now, so that we don't have that problem again!
    - Learning graphs/doing graph code challenges while studying for final whiteboards
        - would it be better to swap these two weeks? or would you be even more burnt-out and not interested in graphs?
