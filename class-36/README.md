## Feedback Review

### The Good/Most Helpful

- having me back <3
- switching from TaskMaster to standalone labs
    - more standalone is coming this week, too... for better or for worse!
- mock interviews/whiteboard prep
- Demos/code examples

### The Least Helpful

- Tech talk assignment
    - It's new, and that's an adjustment
- Requests for more cheat sheets for these services
    - This week, we automate some of that deployment work
