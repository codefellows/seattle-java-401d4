# Java Workflow

For the first half of this course (until midterm projects), we'll use this workflow to create, edit, debug, and run our new projects.

1. From the command line, create the directory that will hold your work and `cd` into it.
2. Run `gradle init --type java-(library|application)`, depending on whether you're creating a library or an application.
3. Open IntelliJ with that directory as the root level of the project.
4. In the dropdown at the top right, create a new configuration. The Gradle command to run is `test`, and nothing else needs to be modified.
5. Save your configuration, and you'll be able to run, debug, test, etc. your code.
