## Deployment Review

Partner up with someone who isn't working on the same deployment application you are. Take turns to walk your partner through your process so far: how far you've gotten, what the pain points have been, what next steps your team is planning. This should go at least 15ish minutes per partner; please go into detail about what you've been working on!
