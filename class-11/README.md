# Class 11: Java and the Web Request-Response Cycle

## Agenda
- Announcements
    - Feedback Roundup
    - Reminder: Michelle out Friday
- Code review
    - Stacks & Queues
- Daily Systems: echo, cat, redirecting output
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
- Lab intro

## Warmup Questions
1. What's the difference between an object and a class?
2. What's the difference between an interface and a class?
3. In what order do you perform these actions? You have a problem in front of you, so you...
    - write tests
    - run code
    - deploy
    - search the internet for the problem
    - check that there's not a simple library you can pull in to solve this problem for you
    - make sure you understand what the problem is asking
    - look at previous examples of similar projects you have worked on
    - run tests
    - draw pictures of the problem
    - draw pictures of your intended solution
4. What is the web request/response cycle? Draw a picture with a client and a server.
5. What formats are involved in transferring data over the Internet?
6. How do we deal with those formats in Java?

## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Making PPH optional
    - I'm so glad it's helping.
- Code challenges
    - I saw this too; several of you are engaging deeply with code challenges, and it's AWESOME.
- Labs
    - And particularly optional-partners
    - Do you want optional-partners on Weds code challenges, too?
- TAs, specifically Evan
    - <3
- Lecture, in general
    - Last week, week 2, is my favorite week of the entire Java curriculum! It definitely comes through in my lectures.
    - This week, we get into Spring. It won't be as... fun. It'll be okay.

### The Mixed

- Code review
    - Still showing up for many people as most helpful, and for some as "going too long"
    - Will continue to warn when I anticipate that code review will go long

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- The career coaching workshop
    - Structure of it
    - Topics covered
    - Justification/reasoning behind the advice given
    - All feedback passed along to Rachel
- People are still feeling confused/uncertain about inheritance and interfaces
    - Honestly? That's normal.
    - We'll keep practicing.
- Daily journals/reflections
    - What if it were in a more readable/revisitable format? It's something that should be useful to future-you, as well.
    - But, also, the journals will continue.
