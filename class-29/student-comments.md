### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Short week felt rushed
- Instruction felt a little bit disjointed with multiple voices
- Career Coaching
- Building (yet another) CRUD app when we're supposed to be in AWS
- Want more Java and less AWS
- AWS, Security (whoops on that key thing), Uncertainty
- Sorting Algos

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- More Scaffolding to be provided? (starer code?)
- Start lecture with a base of code and not go from Zero
  - Maybe I'll start with a code review to get us there?
- Find a better way to get us the deets as a reference (do this, then that).
- Find the right balance between demo and code review
- Add some short videos to the readings/prep


#### Questions from John

- Do you want to get more into CODE or Theory with AWS?
- I need more details on these!
