## Feedback Review

In summary: Your feedback, in general, seems to say that I don't know how to teach and shouldn't be teaching you. This morning, when I read through this feedback, I cried and considered quitting my job. I know that I am a good instructor, and that I also have the capacity to continue to improve, but your feedback makes me question those fundamental truths. Last week, I worked (unpaid) overtime to incorporate codealongs, and I still got more negative feedback than ever when the codealongs limited how quickly we could move through new content. Why should I bother trying to improve anything?

- if there was a good lesson plan, the instructor could easily gauge which parts of the lecture should be code alongs.
- please spend adequate time for lectures.
- Maybe explaining from a perspective, that crowd is un ware of topic that is been taught rather than just going all over all place. One of the things which can be done to properly convoy your message to your audience can be, having your task for day in organized fashion and explaining why the step taken is necessary and what errors can occurs in the absence of it.
- course does not flow well. the lectures do not seem prepared. time is not spent well.
- Topics are not discussed in-depth.  Please ensure the basic concepts are taught.
- When students ask questions, the most of the response isn't clear or isn't explained well.
- The gradient of difficulty increased too quickly this week.  We went from "here is how you get Java to serve up something to a front end based on routes" to "implement a full stack CRUD app that accesses routes and syncs to a database.." on the next day.  For real?
- On Wednesday and Thursdays, as usual, the lectures seems SOOOO unprepared. It's just coding on the fly. Which seems very unprofessional as we DO NOT need to watch the instructor spend half the time researching on why the code isn't work. Then end up having to take a break early so that she can try and just fix her code herself. The lectures should be prepared before hand via, the instructor having coded the demo already and THEN having us code along with her the working code that was already done before. It's 401! We KNOW that we'll hit bugs and things like that and we know how to Google things. The problem with coding the lectures on the fly is it's extremely inefficient and not EVERYONE will actually have the same bugs that the instructor is getting while she's coding on the fly. We end up wasting so much time watching the instructor just google stuff to fix broken code.
- Since we are moving towards heavier contents than previous topics. Course instruction time should be properly organized.
- Least helpful at this point - lectures. they are too short because code / lab reviews last 1 hour each. the reviews are important - but they really shouldn't last more than 20 / 30 min each.


#### How Are We Spending Our Time
    - This week went well.
    - Everything is on track and looking good from my perspective.
    - The code alongs are a great help. 
    - Least helpful: lectures. they are too short because code / lab reviews last 1 hour each.
    - Least helpful: Too much time spent on code review while teaching the new topic felt rushed.
    - Most helpful: I got a lot from some parts of the lectures, especially regarding the extensions from stacks and queues.
    - Most helpful: Coding along without the rush.
    - Most helpful: lecture
    - Most helpful: Code alongs, especially for setup of new material
    - Most helpful: code review
    - Most helpful: working with error messages
    - More time to work on lab assignments would be a big help.
    - if there was a good lesson plan, the instructor could easily gauge which parts of the lecture should be code alongs.
    - I just felt it was not structured properly. Everything was rushed.
    - Content is good, Time this week is also good.
    - We end up wasting so much time watching the instructor just google stuff to fix broken code.
    - One of the things which can be done to properly convoy your message to your audience can be, having your task for day in organized fashion and explaining why the step taken is necessary and what errors can occurs in the absence of it.
    - Major difficulty figuring out the syntax and coding patterns when using the ORM that comes with spring for the songr app. It's probably due to the the sparse examples and documentation available on the internet.

#### Let's look at Brook's lecture in particular
    - Least helpful: To be honest, Brook's lecture got a bit too granular
    - On Friday, we spent a lot of time discussing absolute fundamentals of the materials that we are covering (to the extent that the lecture ran past 5pm with just one break through the lecture). It would be great if we could fine a middle ground where we actually maintain a decent pace and cover the concepts of the materials.
    - We had a great discussion with Brook on Friday about how Spring works that I think would of been great to have on Monday or Tuesday before our labs.

#### Providing resources (i.e. readings)
    - I'll continue to do my best.
